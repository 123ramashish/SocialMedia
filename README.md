This project is built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB to let people interact with each other and their friends. Users can create profiles, post content, like and comment on posts, and engage with the community.

The backend uses Node.js and Express to handle server tasks, while MongoDB, along with Mongoose, manages the database. Mongoose helps organize and validate data.

Main features include user signup and login, profile management, posting updates, and liking or commenting on posts. All these interactions are stored in MongoDB, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

To help developers use the API, Swagger documentation is included. Swagger provides a clear and interactive guide to all API endpoints, showing how to make requests and what responses to expect. This makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

Overall, this project uses popular web technologies to create a social platform where users can connect and interact. The combination of JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB ensures a strong and efficient application, while Swagger documentation makes it developer-friendly.
